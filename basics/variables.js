// there are mainly 4 types of defining variables in js

// first one is through const
// const is used when we are sure that provided value is not going to change this is going to be same
// because we can't change the value we assined in const variable
const accountId = 12345;

// second type is var
// var nowdays used very less becase of block problems or functional problems
var name = "gaurav";

// third type is let
// let is commonly used nowdays because it resolve the problem of 
// block and functional porblem 
let age = 18;


// forth is directly
// this is very bad way to practice while coding in js
state = "uttakhand";
